            * 
            * By defaut, this method generates an Align instance
            * containing only the polymorphic sites. The integers of
            * the DataMatrix will be converted as follow: 0 to A, 1 to
            * C, 2 to G and 3 to T. This behaviour can be largely
            * modified using options.
            * 
            * \param dataMatrix DataMatrix instance.
            * 
            * \param length length of the desired alignment. Non-varying
            * stretches of data will be introduced to reach the
            * specified length. By default the positions of segregating
            * sites will be determined from the positions given by the
            * DataMatrix object. Those positions are expressed in a
            * continuous range, and will be discretized. Mutations
            * falling on the same site will be moved of one position
            * left or right (always preserving the order of mutation
            * sites). If positions are all zero (the default of the
            * DataMatrix class) and if length is larger than the number
            * of segregating sites, then all segregating sites will
            * cluster on the left-hand side of the alignment.
            * 
            * \param random the address to a Random object allowing to 
            * draw random numbers (for randomizing positions and/or
            * non-varying states). If an address is provided but no
            * random numbers are required, it is ignored. If no address
            * if provided and random numbers are required, a Random
            * instance is built internally.
            * 
            * \param randomizePositions if true, the positions specified
            * in the DataMatrix objects are ignored and the positions of
            * mutations are drawn randomly along the interval (only if
            * the specified length is larger than the number of
            * segregating sites). If randomizePositions and false and
            * positions are not
            * 
            * \param enforceLength specify whether a
            * EggRuntimeError should be thrown when the number of
            * polymorphic sites is larger than the specified length. If
            * false (the default) and in cases where the specified
            * length is too short to harbor all polymorphic sites, the
            * alignment length will be increased as needed.
            * 
            * \param randomizeNonVaryingStates if true, the stretches of
            * conserved positions (between segregating sites) will be
            * randomly drawn from the current symbol mapping. Otherwise,
            * the symbol given by fixed will be used.
            * 
            * \param randomizeAlleles if true, alleles will be drawn
            * randomly from the mapped characters. Note that if a
            * genotype value is larger than the size of the mapping, it
            * will be replaced by the character given by unknown,
            * without randomization. In other words, with the mapping
            * "ACGT", alleles 0, 1, 2 and 3 will be randomly assigned
            * to these four characters, but larger and negative alleles
            * will be assigned to the unknown character.
            * 
            * \param mapping a string given the character to assign to
            * different character values read from the DataMatrix. If
            * the read value is 0, the first character of the string
            * will used, the the value is 1, the second character will
            * be used, and so on. If the integer read is out of range
            * (in particular, for any negative value), then the
            * character given by unknown will be used. An empty string
            * will always lead to alignments containing only the
            * character given by unknown. The string "01" is suitable
            * for binary data.
            * 
            * \param unknown the character to use if an integer genotype
            * value is not mapped in the mapping string (that is, if
            * the mapping string is too short).
            * 
            * \param nonVaryingState character to use for conserved
            * stretches of data. It doesn't have to be included in the
            * mapping. If randomizeNonVaryingState is true, this
            * argument is ignored.
            *
