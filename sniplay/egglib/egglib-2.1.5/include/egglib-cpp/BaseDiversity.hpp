/** \defgroup polymorphism polymorphism
 *
 * \brief Diversity analyses
 *
 * Two classes are contained in this module: NucleotideDiversity, that
 * performs site-centered polymorphism analyses, and HaplotypeDiversity,
 * that performs haplotype-centered analyses. The detection of
 * polymorphic sites is common to both, through the base class
 * BaseDiversity. However this phase must be repeated when stats from
 * the two classes are needed. To reduce the computational burden, the
 * function reserve() can be use, that directly allocates needed memory
 * when the eventual number of polymorphic sites is known prior to
 * analysis (even if not precisely). For both classes, a set of
 * statistics are computed immediately upon load of a data set. For
 * NucleotideDiversity, additional statistics are computed per group
 * upon use of the corresponding accessors. This number of operations
 * performed several times is strictly limited. This is particularly
 * useful when different statistics are needed for a given alignment.
 * However, this system allows not computing unnecessary statistics to
 * a certain extend.
