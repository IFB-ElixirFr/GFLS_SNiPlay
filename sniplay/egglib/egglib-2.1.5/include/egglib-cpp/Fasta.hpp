    *
    * \ingroup core
    *
    * Reads a multifasta sequence file from a string, a stream or a file
    * and returns a Container. See the description of the format below.
    * Formats a fasta string from a sequence container object and places
    * it in a string, a stream of a file. All methods are static and the
    * class cannot be instantiated. The methods parsef and formatf will
    * open the file for you while the others will read/write directly
    * in a string.
    * 
    * Specifications of the fasta format:
    * 
    *    - The number of sequences is not limited.
    * 
    *    - Each sequence is preceded by a header limited to a single
    *      line and starting by a ">" character.
    * 
    *    - The header length is not limited and all characters are
    *      allowed but white spaces and special characters are
    *      discouraged.
    * 
    *    - Group indices are specified by \@0, \@1, \@2...  strings
    *      appearing at the end of the header string (just before the
    *      carriage return). Note that group labels are ignored by
    *      default.
    * 
    *    - Group indices are ignored unless specifically specified in a
    *      parser's options.
    * 
    *    - The sequence itself continues on following lines until the
    *      next ">" character or the end of the file.
    * 
    *    - White spaces, tab and carriage returns are allowed at any
    *      position There is no limitation in length and different
    *      sequences can have different lengths.
    * 
    *    - Although the standard is lower case characters, Fasta
    *      assumes upper case characters and only supports lower case
    *      characters (and converts them to upper case characters).
    *      Information coded by change in case is lost.
